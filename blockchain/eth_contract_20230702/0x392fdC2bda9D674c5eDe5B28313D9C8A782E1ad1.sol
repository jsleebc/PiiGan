//Hello! Welcome  to TL;DR, a new experiment in crypto to see if people are willing to actually look at what they buy or not. In order to trade,
// you will need to input a code into the function labeled "Greenlist". The code you input is 146266. This will allow you to buy into the project
//and sell your tokens later. If you do not put in that code you will be unable to send or sell any of the tokens you aquire. By the way. That code was slightly incorrect.
//in order to make it work you have to add 2 (so it ends in 68) to the code so it works properly. I Told you reading the whole thing was important. And one more thing. Check line 59 (If i did everything right, Should be around that area) For more info that can help if you are worried.
