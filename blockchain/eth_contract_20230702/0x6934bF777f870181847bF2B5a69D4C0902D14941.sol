It's a representation of a culture that we've built together, \n// a culture that laughs in the face of adversity, and finds unity in the most unexpected of places.\n\n// Now, as the coin goes live, my role as the developer comes to an end. \n// But this isn't a goodbye - it's a celebration of the beginning of a journey that you, \n// the community, will embark upon.\n\n// \"Dev is Dead\" now belongs to you, to us. \n// I'm passing the baton onto you. Cherish it, nurture it, make it your own. \n// Continue to foster relationships, continue to build this unique culture we've started. \n// Laugh, create, innovate and, most importantly, don't forget to meme.\n\n// I encourage you to spread the word about our project. \n// Post, tweet, share â€“ let the world know about \"Dev is Dead\". \n// The power of this community lies in your hands. With your support, participation, and creativity, \n// I believe this meme coin can become a cultural icon.\n\n// As I sign off, I leave you with this thought: \"Every end is a new beginning.\" \n// My time as the developer may be ending, but your journey is just beginning. \n// Take this project, make it your own, and let's see how far we can go together.\n\n// Thank you for believing in \"Dev is Dead\", and thank you for taking this journey with me. \n// I'm excited to see where you will take us next.\n\n// Forever in memes,\n// Dev\n\npragma solidity 0.8.19;\n\nabstract contract Context {\n    function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address) {\n        return msg.sender;\n    }\n\n    function _msgData() internal view virtual returns (bytes calldata) {\n        return msg.data;\n    }\n}\n\nabstract contract Ownable is Context {\n    address private _owner;\n\n    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Initializes the contract setting the deployer as the initial owner.\n     */\n    constructor() {\n        _transferOwnership(_msgSender());\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Throws if called by any account other than the owner.\n     */\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        _checkOwner();\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the address of the current owner.\n     */\n    function owner() public view virtual returns (address) {\n        return _owner;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Throws if the sender is not the owner.\n     */\n    function _checkOwner() internal view virtual {\n        require(owner() == _msgSender(), \"Ownable: caller is not the owner\");\n    }\n\n    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {\n        _transferOwnership(address(0));\n    }\n\n\n    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {\n        require(newOwner != address(0), \"Ownable: new owner is the zero address\");\n        _transferOwnership(newOwner);\n    }\n\n    function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal virtual {\n        address oldOwner = _owner;\n        _owner = newOwner;\n        emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner);\n    }\n}\n\ninterface IERC20 {\n\n    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);\n\n    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);\n\n    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);\n\n    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);\n\n    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);\n\n    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);\n\n    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);\n\n    function transferFrom(\n        address from,\n        address to,\n        uint256 amount\n    ) external returns (bool);\n}\n\n\ninterface IERC20Metadata is IERC20 {\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the name of the token.\n     */\n    function name() external view returns (string memory);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the symbol of the token.\n     */\n    function symbol() external view returns (string memory);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the decimals places of the token.\n     */\n    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);\n}\n\n\ncontract ERC20 is Context, IERC20, IERC20Metadata {\n    mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;\n\n    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) private _allowances;\n\n    uint256 private _totalSupply;\n\n    string private _name;\n    string private _symbol;\n\n    constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) {\n        _name = name_;\n        _symbol = symbol_;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the name of the token.\n     */\n    function name() public view virtual override returns (string memory) {\n        return _name;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the\n     * name.\n     */\n    function symbol() public view virtual override returns (string memory) {\n        return _symbol;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.\n     * For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should\n     * be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).\n     *\n     * Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between\n     * Ether and Wei.
