$KEKW. A meme coin to #KEK about. A coins for the people, by the people. As the great man El Risitas once said - "Kek"
AS THE SUN ASCENDS ON THE THIRD DAY, EL RISITAS RISES. TIRED OF WATCHING EVERYONE BOUNCE FROM DOGCOIN TO FROGCOIN, THE CHOSEN ONE KNOWS THAT NOW IS HIS TIME.

WHERE ONCE THERE WAS SILENCE, NOW THERE IS SOUND.
THE SOUND OF KEK.

ITâ€™S TIME FOR THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE LAUGH IN THE WORLD TO RING THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TO SPREAD JOY. LOVE. WONDER... & MEMES.

KEKW IS HERE TO TAKE OVER. A STEALTH LAUNCH. NO PRESALE. A lok LP. A RENOUNCED CONTRACT.

WE'VE SEEN WHAT FROGS CAN DO. BUT WHAT ABOUT GODS?
